# Hello(*´▽｀)ノ.  Welcome to my blog.

My name is **Jiaqi Shen**. Living and working now in [Hangzhou, China](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%AD%E5%B7%9E/147639).

I graduated from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%AC%E9%82%AE%E7%94%B5%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/1004526) in 2020, and now I am working as a frontend development engineer in [Hithink Flush](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%99%E6%B1%9F%E6%A0%B8%E6%96%B0%E5%90%8C%E8%8A%B1%E9%A1%BA%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E8%82%A1%E4%BB%BD%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8/6782222), which is a listed internet financy company.

My main tech stack is `javascript` and `vue`, and now gradually migrating to `TypeScript`. My work is currently focusing on `lowcode platform`、`UI component library` and `business material market` construction. I also love writing some gadgets, like `vscode extension`、`npm packages` and some other libraries. I dream of being a great technologist.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing pingpong, singing and reading usually, and I recently fell in love with listening to podcast while driving. I will write some experience sharing in my blog after.

My life motto is: &nbsp;Better go home and weave a net than to stand by the pond longing for fish. Translated in Chinese is "临渊羡鱼，不如退而结网". <br/>
Focus on what we love and keep doing , we will eventually find the meaning of life.
